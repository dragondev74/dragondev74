Thank you for visiting my profile.

I have been working on web backend and frontend development as a full-stack engineer for over 8 years.

I specialize in developing websites, mobile applications, and managing complex projects growing their business.
And in the last three years alone I have worked with dozens of clients in different roles.
And on average I've been able to help my clients really increase their business income and grow their ranking boost in less than six months.
That's what I am passionate about.
In fact, I have listed some of those clients that I've worked with in my experience section below.

My real strength is my ability to truly understand what client wants and solve the problems of what they are facing.
I pride myself on my result of struggling for making reality from ideas that the client loves and wants to implement.

What I am looking for is a company that I could add value to, that I could produce a positive return on investment.
Thank you.
